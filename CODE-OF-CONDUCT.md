# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to fostering an open and welcoming environment.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

If a contributor engages in unacceptable behavior, the maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including a temporary or permanent ban from the project.

## Reporting Issues

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported by contacting [email@domain.com].

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

We expect participants to follow this code of conduct in all project spaces and during project-related activities.
